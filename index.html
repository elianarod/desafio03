          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Jake lives with his parents, Jonathan and Susan, and his younger
            sister, Haley Long in New York City. A descendant of a family of
            magical dragons, his two best friends are the feisty Trixie Carter
            and seemingly dim-witted Arthur "Spud" Spudinski. Before his
            thirteenth birthday, Jake started getting glimpses of his dragon
            heritage. On his thirteenth birthday, his magical abilities fully
            emerged and he was set to protect an underground magical community
            existing within his city and throughout the world. The emergence of
            his dragon powers also made him the first official magical dragon
            guardian of America; <strong>"The American Dragon"</strong>. Under
            the training of his grandfather, Lao Shi, and his animal guardian,
            Fu Dog, Jake would be taught in the methods of his dragon abilities,
            and in his duties as a magical guardian. Although Jake is still in
            the early training stages to be the American Dragon, his destiny
            includes being the guardian, protector, and champion to magical
            creatures secretly living alongside humans in and around New York
            City, and eventually the rest of the country.

          <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
          <p>
            In <strong>human form</strong>, Jake is an average-looking but short
            for his age teenager with black, spiky hair with green highlights.
            He wears a red jacket which conceals a white t-shirt, blue cargo
            shorts, and gray shoes. <br />For formal wear, Jake wears a dark
            navy dress suit with a red dress shirt, yellow necktie, and black
            and white dress shoes.<br />
            At times, Jake wears a purple-and-black tuxedo.<br />
            When in <strong>dragon form</strong>, he looks like a tall,
            muscular, red-scaled dragon with wings, a yellow underbelly and
            green spikes along his back. His hair remains the same in his dragon
            form. In the second season, his design changes drastically, his
            skinnier and a darker shade of red. His appearance is more in theme
            with his heritage.

        <article>
          <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Shapeshifting:</strong> Jake can transform between human and
            <span>dragon</span> forms at will, at the beginning of the series,
            he initially had trouble transforming completely into dragon form,
            as he could only partly transform, however, Jake eventually is able
            to completely transform into his dragon form. <br />
            <strong>Breath:</strong> In both his human and dragon forms, Jake
            can breathe fire.
            <br />
            <strong>Superhuman Strength:</strong> In his dragon form, Jake
            possesses superhuman strength. He can lift heavy objects (10-20
            ton), crush stone with his fists, bend steel bars or rip iron chains
            with his arms.
            <br />
            <strong>Superhuman Senses:</strong> In his dragon form, Jake
            possesses superhuman senses. This include superhuman hearing and
            sight, both in which case he partially transforms into dragon form.
            <br />
            <strong>Flight:</strong> In his dragon form, Jake is able to fly,
            and once flew up to 179 mph to avoid being hit by a flying boulder
            going 180 mph.
            <br />
            <strong>Duplication:</strong> Like a standard dragon, Jake can
            create one clone of himself. But with a chi amplifier potion, Jake
            can multiple energy clones of himself; although, the more clones he
            creates, the physically weaker he becomes, however, once Jake
            reabsorbs his clone(s), his physical strength will return back to
            normal.
